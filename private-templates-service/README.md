# Running the Adaptive Cards Admin Portal Locally

To run this web application locally, you must have the following installed on your system:

-   Git
-   [Node v12](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

**1. Clone the repository.**

**2. Depending on what environment you would like to run locally (master, stage or dev), switch to the appropriate branch.**

**3. Modify the `Config.tsx` file.**

The Adaptive Cards Admin Portal lives under `adaptivecards-templates/private-templates-service`.
Modify the file `adaptivecards-templates/private-templates-service/client/src/Config.tsx` such that the redirectUri points to `http:\\localhost:3000`.

**4. Inside of `adaptivecards-templates/private-templates-service/client` run `npm install`.**

**5. Finally, run ``npm start` to launch the application in your default browser.**

**You're good to go!**

## Troubleshooting

-   When running `npm start`, confirm in your shell that the localhost port matches the port in the `Config.tsx` redirectUri. It should be port 3000 but it can be different.

# Nodejs download on WSL

1. To download compatable nodejs, npm

```
sudo apt-get autoremove --purge npm node nodejs
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

# Running the Adaptive Cards Template Service API Locally

## Installation steps

Using the endpoints currently requires installing MongoDB locally. Download [MongoDB's Community Server](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community?jmp=nav).

Download [Postman](https://app.getpostman.com/app/download/win64) to test the endpoints.

#### Setting up your own app with Azure AD for testing

If you have a client secret for the app deployed at https://adaptivecms.azurewebsites.net/, ignore this step.

Login to Azure portal and go to Azure Active Directory. Click App registrations, and create a new registration. Under supported account types, select '_Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory - Multitenant) and personal Microsoft accounts_' and click Register.

Select the app you just registered and go to Authentication. Under Implicit Grant, enable both Access tokens and ID tokens. Under Certificates & secrets, add a new Client secret and record the value.

### Running the backend

Under `adaptivecards-templates/private-template-service/src/config/config.ts`, add the client ID of the Azure AD app under the clientID field.

Under `adaptivecards-templates/private-template-service` run `npm install`.

Run `npm start`.

### Using Postman to test endpoints

#### Obtaining an access token

Post a request to https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant_id}/oauth2/token using Postman.
In the body add keys grant_type, client_id, client_secret, and resource.

**grant_type**: client_credentials

**client_id**: {client id for app registered with Azure AD}

**client_secret**: {client secret for app registered with Azure AD}

**resource**: {client_id}

Post the request and copy the access_token field in the response.

#### Sending a request

Create a new request with Postman and select either GET or POST for `http://localhost:5000/template`. Under Headers, add the key 'Authorization' and add the value as 'Bearer {access_token}'.

Leaving out the Authorization header should return a 401 Unauthorized error.

### Get templates

This endpoint returns a list of all known templates.

> `HTTP GET https://localhost:5000/template`

**Response excerpt**

```json
[
	{
		"_id": "5e2f6de4c4a23957d4dfb4dc",
		"template": "{}",
		"isPublished": false,
		"created": "2020-01-27T23:10:28.564Z",
		"__v": 0
	}
]
```

This endpoint returns a template given the template id.

> `HTTP GET https://localhost:5000/template/{template_id}`

### Post a template

This endpoints creates a new template and returns 201 if successfully created.

# Linting and Code Convention Setup for VSCode

**1. Download the following extensions for VSCode:**

-   ESLint
-   Prettier - Code formatter
-   Babel ES6/ES7

The project is setup to contain a .vscode folder with all the setting configuration for these VSCode extension.

**2. To install all node modules needed for code formatting on save:**

```
npm install
```

At this point, ESLint and Prettier should work in conjuction to auto-format all files on save.
A restart of VScode may be required.

## Confirm Valid Setup

To confirm that you are setup correctly, open a js file in the repository and write the following:

```
const l = [1,2,3,
4,    5,
6];
```

Once you save the file, this line of code should be code formatted as below:

```
const l = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
```

## Troubleshooting

Things to watch out for:

-   You **must** have auto-saving turned off on VSCode. Saving needs to be manually triggered.
-   Make sure you are accessing the repo by opening the repository folder in VSCode rather than particular files in the repository. To do so, in VSCode, go to File -> Open Folder and open the adaptivecards-templates folder.
